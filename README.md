255 term project
In the, CMPE_255 repository we have 3 files:
EDA file: The exploratory data analysis to find patterns in data and to check if some of the columns are redundant. In this section we made use of the Plotly library of Python in order to make graphs more interactive. We have tried to analyze the dataset by plotting it for different set of attributes.

CMPE255_Unsampled: Direct implementation of the differnet Machine Learning algorithms. We dropped a few features and performed value imputation, more information regarding the same can be found in the notebook.

CMPE_255_TERM_project: In this notebook, we have the grid search_cv implementation on the sampled data and the evaluation metrics were also observed. The results generated had high accuracies. 

Note: All the notebooks are made with the help of Google colab. In order to run them, please download the data from https://www.kaggle.com/sobhanmoosavi/us-accidents, extract the files on local system and upload the extracted dataset on your google drive. The initial code for mounting the drive and loading the datatset will work absolutely fine if the above steps are followed correctly.
